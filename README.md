🔐 Password Strength Checker  
  
  This is a Java program I built after coming across a website that used a cool password strength feature. 
  It had checkboxes that updated dynamically as I typed in a password, showing if it met the required criteria. I decided to recreate the same feature in Java!

🌟 Features  
  - As the user types, the program checks the password against multiple criteria.  
  - If you add or remove a specific requirement (like a capital letter), the corresponding checkbox updates instantly.
  - You can modify the criteria easily if you want to enforce different password rules. 

📋 Criteria for a Strong Password  
  1. Includes at least one uppercase letter.  
  2. Includes at least one number.  
  3. Includes at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).  
  4. Is at least 12 characters long.  


Installation  
  1. Clone this repository:  
     ```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/Victor-W510/ThePasswordProject.git  

Usage

  Enter a password in the program's prompt.
  Watch as the criteria boxes are checked or unchecked in real-time, based on the password input.
  Adjust your password until all criteria are met for maximum strength.

🛠 Customization
  You can modify the password rules by adjusting the code logic in the Main class. For example, to add a new criterion or change the length requirement, update the corresponding method.
